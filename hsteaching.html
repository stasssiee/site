    <p>In my senior year of high school, I was lucky enough to be given the opportunity to make notes on the AoPS books and teach 
        a few people I knew dearly some mathematics from these books that I had gained from my many years of contest math.

    <p>Here are the different courses I was able to write notes on (this is based on the normal high school curriculum).</p>

    <ul>
        <li><a href = "courses/prealg.html">Prealgebra</a></li>
        <li><a href = "courses/alg1.html">Algebra 1</a></li>
        <li><a href = "courses/geo.html">Geometry</a></li>
        <li><a href = "courses/alg2.html">Algebra 2</a></li>
        <li><a href = "courses/precal.html">Precalculus</a></li>
