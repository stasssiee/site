\chapter{Differential Equations}
A differentiable equation is an equation that involves a derivative.

Steps to draw a slope field:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Choose a $(x,y)$ point to graph.
    \item PLug that point into $\frac{\mathrm{d}y}{\mathrm{d}x}$
    \item Draw a line fragment that represents the slope found in \#2 at the point chosen in \#1.
\end{itemize}

Problem 1: Consider the differential equation given by $\frac{\mathrm{d}y}{\mathrm{d}x} = \frac{xy}{2}$.

(a) Draw a slope field for the given differential equation.

(b) Let $f$ be the function that satisfies the given differential equation. Write an equation for the tangent line to the curve $y=f(x)$ through the point $(1,1)$.
Then use your tangent line equation to estimate the value of $f(1.2)$.

Problem 2: Consider the differential equation $\frac{\mathrm{d}y}{\mathrm{d}x}=\frac{1}{2}x+y-1$.

(a) Sketch a slope field for the given differential equation.

(b) Find $\frac{\mathrm{d}^2y}{\mathrm{d}x^2}$ in terms of $x$ and $y$. Describe the region in the $xy$-plane in which all solution curves to the differential equation are concave up.

(c) Let $y=f(x)$ be a particular solution to the differential equation with the initial condiction $f(0)=1$. Does $f$ have a relative minimum, a relative maximum, or neither at $x=0$? Justify your answer.
