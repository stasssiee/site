\section{The Chain Rule}
The chain rule formula is 
\[y=f(g(h(x))) \rightarrow y'=f'(g(h(x)))\cdot g'(h(x))\cdot h'(x)\cdot 1\]

Problem 1: Differentiate $h(x)=\sec^2 x$.

Problem 2: Differentiate $h(x)=\frac{4}{\sqrt{x^3+2}}$.

Problem 3: Differentiate $e^{-x^2}$.
\section{L'Hopital's Rule}
L'Hopital's Rule:

Suppose $f(a)=0$ and $g(a)=0$ and $lim_{x\to 0}\frac{f(x)}{g(x)}=\frac{``0''}{0}$ or $\frac{``\infty''}{\infty}$. L'Hopital's Rule allows 
you to apply the following
\[\lim_{x\to a}\frac{f(x)}{g(x)}=\lim_{x\to a}\frac{f'(x)}{g'(x)}\]

Problem 1: Evaluate the following. $\lim_{x\to 0}\frac{1-\cos x}{x^2}$.

Problem 2: Evaluate the following: $\lim_{x\to 2}\frac{e^{2x}-e^4}{x-2}$.
\section{Implicit Differentiation}
When you cannot isolate $y$ in terms of $x$ or one variable, then you want to take the derivative implicitly.

The steps are essentially to take the derivative normally and then move anything containing $\frac{dy}{dx}$ or $y'$ to one side. Then you 
want to create only one $\frac{dy}{dx}$ or $y'$ term by factoring and then solve for this term.

Problem 1: Solve for $\frac{dy}{dx}$ for $3x^2+4xy^2-5x^3=10$.

Problem 2: Find the equation of the tangent line for $x^2+y^2=4$ at $x=1$.

Problem 3: Find $\frac{d^2y}{dx^2}$ for $y^2-3y=2x^2+x$ in terms of $x$ and $y$.

Problem 4: A curve is generated by the equation $x^2+4y^2=16$. How many points on this curve have tangent lines that are horizontal?
\section{Inverse Functions \& their Derivatives}
Recall for inverse functions that domain and range are switched and slopes are reciprocals. 

The derivative of an inverse function:
\[\frac{d}{dx}[f^{-1}(x)]=\frac{1}{f'(x)}\]

Note the inverse trig derivatives:
\begin{itemize}
    \item $\frac{d}{dx}\sin^{-1}x = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1-x^2}}$
    \item $\frac{d}{dx}\cos^{-1}x = -\frac{1}{\sqrt{1-x^2}}$
    \item $\frac{d}{dx}\sec^{-1}x = \frac{1}{|x|\sqrt{x^2-1}}$
    \item $\frac{d}{dx}\csc^{-1}x = -\frac{1}{|x|\sqrt{x^2-1}}$
    \item $\frac{d}{dx}\tan^{-1}x = \frac{1}{x^2+1}$
    \item $\frac{d}{dx}\cot^{-1}x = -\frac{1}{x^2+1}$
\end{itemize}

Problem 1: If $f(x)=\cos x - 6x$ and $f^{-1}(-9\pi) = \frac{3\pi}{2}$, find the derivative of $f^{-1}(x)$ at $x=-9\pi$.

Problem 2: Find the derivative of $\sec^{-1}5x^6$.
