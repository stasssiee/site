\section{Vector Spaces and Subspaces}
A vector space is a nonempety set $V$ of objects, called vectors, on which are defined two operations called addition and scalar multiplication to the 10 axioms listed below. The axioms must hold for all vectors $\textbf{u}$, $\textbf{v}$, and $\textbf{w}$ in $V$ and for all scalars $a$ and $b$.

Closure Properties:
\begin{itemize}
    \item $\textbf{u}+\textbf{v}$ is a vector in $V$
    \item $a\textbf{v}$ is a vector in $V$
\end{itemize}

Properties of Addition:
\begin{itemize}
    \item commutative: $\textbf{u}+\textbf{v}=\textbf{v}+\textbf{u}$
    \item associative: $\textbf{u}+(\textbf{v}+\textbf{w})=(\textbf{u}+\textbf{v})+\textbf{w}$
    \item additive identity: there is a vector $\textbf{0}$ in $V$ such that $\textbf{v}+\textbf{0}=\textbf{v}$ for all $\textbf{v}$ in $V$
    \item additive inverse: given a vector $\textbf{v}$ in $V$, there is a vector $-\textbf{v}$ such that $\textbf{v}+(-\textbf{v})=\textbf{0}$
\end{itemize}

Properties of Scalar Multiplication:
\begin{itemize}
    \item associative: $a(b\textbf{v})=(ab)\textbf{v}$
    \item distributive: $a(\textbf{u}+\textbf{v})=a\textbf{u}+a\textbf{v}$
    \item distributive: $(a+b)\textbf{v}=a\textbf{v}+b\textbf{v}$
    \item multiplicative identity: $1\textbf{v}=\textbf{v}$ for all $\textbf{v}$ in $V$
\end{itemize}

A subspace of a vector space, $V$, is a subset $H$ of $V$ that has three properties:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item the zero vector of $V$ is $H$
    \item $H$ is closed under vector addition 
    \item $H$ is closed under scalar multiplication
\end{enumerate}

A subspace $H$ of $V$ itself is a vector space. The other properties of a vector space are ``inherited'' since $H$ is a subset of $V$.

\begin{theorem}
    If $\textbf{v}_1,\textbf{v}_2,\dots,\textbf{v}_p$ are in a vector space $V$, then Span$\{\textbf{v}_1,\textbf{v}_2,\dots,\textbf{v}_p\}$ is a subspace of $V$.
\end{theorem}

\section{Null Spaces, Column Spaces, Row Spaces, and Linear Transformations}
The Null Space of a $m\times n$ matrix $A$, denoted Nul $A$, is the set of solutions of the homogeneous equation $A\textbf{x}=\textbf{0}$. In set notation: Nul $A$ = $\{\textbf{x}:\textbf{x}$ is in $\textbf{R}^n$ and $A\textbf{x}=\textbf{0}\}$.
\begin{theorem}
    The null space of an $m\times n$ matrix $A$ is a subspace of $\textbf{R}^n$. Equivalently, the set of all solutions to a system $A\textbf{x}=\textbf{0}$ of $m$ homogeneous linear equations in $n$ unknown is a subspace of $\textbf{R}^n$.
\end{theorem}

The Column Space of a $m\times n$ matrix $A$, denoted Col $A$, is the set of all linear combinations of the columns of $A$. If $A=[\textbf{a}_1,\textbf{a}_2,\dots, \textbf{a}_n]$ then Col $A$ = Span$\{\textbf{a}_1,\textbf{a}_2,\dots,\textbf{a}_n\}$.

\begin{theorem}
    The column space of a $m\times n$ matrix $A$ is a subspace of $\textbf{R}^m$.
\end{theorem}

The Row Space of an $m\times n$ matrix $A$, denoted Row $A$, is the set of all linear combinations of the row vectors. Each row has $n$ entries, so the Row $A$ is a subspace of $\textbf{R}^n$.

The null and column space are related. They are very different: When $A$ Is not square, the column space and the null space exist entirely in different ``universes''. For an $m\times n$ matrix, the Column Space is in $m$-dimensional space, where the Null space is in $n$-dimensional space.

Kernel and Range if a Linear Transformation
\begin{itemize}
    \item a Linear Transformation $T$ from a vector space $V$ to be vector space $W$ is a rule that assigns each vector $\textbf{x}$ in $V$ a unique vector $T(\textbf{x})$ in $W$ such that $T(\textbf{u}+\textbf{v})=T(\textbf{u})+T(\textbf{v})$ and 
    $T(c\textbf{u})=cT(\textbf{u})$ for all $\textbf{u},\textbf{v}$ in $V$ and $c$ in $\textbf{R}$.
    \item The Kernel of $T$ is the set of all $\textbf{u}$ in $V$ such that $T(\textbf{u})=\textbf{0}$ 
    \item The Range of $T$ is the set of all vectors in $W$ of the form $T(\textbf{x})$ for some $\textbf{x}$ in $V$
    \item The kernel and range of $T$ are subspaces of $V$
\end{itemize}



\section{Linearly Independent Sets; Bases}
A basis spans a vector space as ``efficiently'' as possible.
\begin{itemize}
    \item linearly independent: an indexed set of vectors $\{\textbf{v}_1,\textbf{v}_2,\dots,\textbf{v}_p\}$ in $V$ is linearly independent if $c_1\textbf{v}_1+c_2\textbf{v}_2+\dots+c_n\textbf{v}_n=\textbf{0}$ has only the trivial solution.
    \item linearly dependent: an indexed set of vectors $\{\textbf{v}_1,\textbf{v}_2,\dots,\textbf{v}_p\}$ in $V$ is linearly dependent if $c_1\textbf{v}_1+c_2\textbf{v}_2+\dots+c_n\textbf{v}_n=\textbf{0}$ has a nontrivial solution 
\end{itemize}

\begin{theorem}
    An indexed set of vectors $\{\textbf{v}_1,\textbf{v}_2,\dots,\textbf{v}_p\}$ of 2 or more vectors with $\textbf{v}_1$ not zero, is linearly dependent if and only if some $\textbf{v}_j(j>1)$ is a linear combination of the preceding vectors 
    $\textbf{v}_1,\textbf{v}_2,\dots,\textbf{v}_{j-1}$.

    This definition is for general vectors where we may be unable to write the vectors as columns of a matrix $A$.
\end{theorem}

Basis: Let $H$ be a subspace of a vector space $V$. A set of vectors $\mathcal{B}$ in $V$ is a basis of $H$ if:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item $\mathcal{B}$ is a linearly independent set and 
    \item the subspace spanned by $\mathcal{B}=H$ (or $H$ = span $\mathcal{B}$)
\end{enumerate}

\begin{theorem}
    $S=\{\textbf{v}_1,\textbf{v}_2,\dots,\textbf{v}_p\}$ is a set in a vector space, and let $H$ = Span$\{\textbf{v}_1,\textbf{v}_2,\dots,\textbf{v}_p\}$.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item if one of the vectors in $S$, say $\textbf{c}_k$, is a linear combination of the remaining vectors in $S$, then the set formed from $S$ by removing $\textbf{v}_k$ still spans $H$.
        \item if $H$ is not equal to $\{\textbf{0}\}$, some subset of $S$ is a basis for $H$
    \end{itemize}
\end{theorem}

The basis if the smallest possible spanning set (because all vectors are linearly independent)

The basis is the largest possible linearly independent set that spans (an additional vector will make the set dependent)
