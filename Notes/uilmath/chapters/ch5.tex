    A random sample of 360 high school seniors in the Texas Panhandle were asked which university they hoped to attend.
    Students were asked to choose between Texas, A\&M, Tech, and TCU. The results are in the able above. Researchers had expected a ratio of $3:3:4:2$ for their choices.
    An appropriate test at the $\alpha = 0.05$ level was performed to see if the observed values differ from what was expected. Based on a $P$-value of \blank, researchers concluded that 
    there was insufficient evidence to show that student choices differ from what was expected.
