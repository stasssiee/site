\section*{Problems}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Given a parabola $y=x^2$, construct graphs for $x(s)$ and $y(s)$.
    \item At 1:00 pm, a ship is 10 miles due east of port. At 2:00 pm, it has sailed to a point that is 20 miles east and 50 miles north of the position at 1:00 pm. Assume that the ship continues to sail in this manner as it did from 1:00 pm to 2:00 pm.
    
    Write a function that will give the ship's position at any time.
    \item Use the fact that $W=||\vec{F}|| ||\vec{d}||\cos\theta$, to show that a satellie orbiting earth does zero work as it travels around the earth.
    \item Use Euler's Number $e^{i\theta}=\cos\theta + i\sin\theta$ to derive some common trigonometric identities.
\end{enumerate}
