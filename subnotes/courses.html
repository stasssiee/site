                reaching out to me to thank me for teaching AP Human Geo. It was a rewarding subject to teach and I,
                honestly, had my doubts that I mixed my real-world experience with the lesson well. Knowing that a
                capable student like you believes I did well makes me feel well accomplished! Also, thanks for asking
                about my business. It had a very slow start but has done well enough that I'm in the process of selling
                my representation contracts then, possibly, returning to the classroom.

                I assume you are college bound? You're about to come of age in a time unlike any other in human history.
                It's both exciting and terrifying with the new technologies that are already here and the ones on the
                way. From LLMs and AI, to humanoid robots already in the workforce, even the commercial fusion power
                plants being built in Virgina and China as well as the recent breakthroughs in genetics and medicine. I
                have no doubt that young men and women like you will take these tools in exciting new directions we
                haven't even conceived yet.

                Thank you again for taking the time to look me up, and reach out to me. If I can ever offer you any
                assistance or even just an ear, don't hesitate to reach out to me.

                Augustine, first of all, of course I absolutely remember you. You were brilliant, beautiful, humorous,
                and such a joy to have around.

                Opening my email to see this message today is a true shock and delight. I cannot thank you enough for
                reaching out. You are exactly right though, the world is a beautiful place full of people with things to
                offer each other and lessons to teach. You no doubt have taught me and still with this message continue
                to teach me.

                Reflection is such an important part of the human species, and I will be forever grateful for your
                words. I'm wishing you so much success, and I hope that you will let me know what you're up to and
                achieving these days as I'm sure it's astounding.

                Regards,

                hooked as a student too.



                Please send me your non-school email so we can keep in touch. Who are you studying violin with post-high
                school/where? I am happy to help any way I can if you have questions with the process. I am so proud of
                what you've achieved! This will be such a great memory to have this recording from your high school
                concert. Way to go on the cadenza chords. Congratulations on your Graduation!</td>
