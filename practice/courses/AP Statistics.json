One question in the survey asks students which of five super powers they would most like to have: Fly, Freeze Time, Invisibility, Super Strength, or Telepathy. From the very large dataset of past responses, we selected a random sample of 100 students and plotted the distribution of Super Power choice in the graph shown below. <br> <img src = 'courses/images/STATS1.10.PNG'> <br> (a) Describe the distribution of Super Power among students in this sample. Include at least three distinct characteristics of the distribution. <br> We wondered whether the apparent characteristics of the Super Power distribution that we saw in our sample of 100 students reflected similar characteristics of the entire population, or if they were just chance \"quirks\" of this particular sample. So we selected three more different random samples of 100 students and did the same thing. The graphs below show the distributions resulting from these samples. <br> <img src = 'courses/images/STATS1.11.PNG'> <br> (b) For each of the characteristics you described in (a), use these new graphs to decide whether the characteristic is likely to be descriptive of the whole population, or if it may easily just have been a change \"quirk\" of the first sample.",

The next most appealing superpowers were Freezing Time and Telepathy, followed by Invisibility. The least frequently chosen was Super Strength. <br> (b) All of the graphs look about the same. This suggests that the proportions of students choosing these superpowers in these samples are pretty to the proportions of students in the whole population who selected them. The differences in proportions across superpowers aren't just quirks of one or two samples - they reflect real differences in the population."
