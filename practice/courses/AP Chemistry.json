The 1st pairing of electrons in oxygen results in increased electron-electron repulsions which results in less energy being required to remove its valence electrons, despite an increase in nuclear pull. <br> (d) The ionization energy of Na will be less than that of either Li or Ne since the valence electrons is a 3s electron in Na as opposed to a 2s or 2p electron.

The 2p electron is more tightly held which means more energy is required to remove it despite the higher Zeff of Mg. <br> (b) Greater shielding in Rb and Cs means the outer shells are more loosely held and can expand to a similar extent to one another, making the difference in their size relatively small. Less shielding in the Na and K atom means the 3s shell experiences significantly more nuclear attraction than the 4s shell, making the difference in atomic radii greater. <br> (c) The valence electron Ni\\(^{2+}\\) and Zn\\(^{2+}\\) have both ions lose the 2 4s electrons to become ions with +2 charge. Ni has unpaired 3d electrons and is thus paramagnetic and attracted to a magnetic field whereas Zn is not since all of its electrons are paired. <br> (d) N has no d-orbitals, therefore it cannot expand its octet and form 5 bonds.

AsF\\(_3\\) is polar since it has a net dipole moment due to the presence of a line pair of electrons.

HNO\\(_2\\) does not exhibit resonance therefore HNO\\(_2\\) has 1 N-O single bond and 1 N=O double bond with different lengths. <br> (d) Sulfur's valence electrons are from the 3rd principle energy level therefore d-orbitals are present, therefore S can expand its octet and form 6 bonds around the central atom.

            "answer": "(a) As the temperature is decreased, the U\\(_{rms}\\) of the gas molecules decreases. This would reduce the frequency of the collisions of gas molecules with the balloon walls. In order to maintain a constant pressure inside the balloon versus the external pressure, the volume must decrease. <br> (b) When temperatures get low, the ideal gas assumption that the gas particles do not attract each other is not a good approximation. When the gas is cooled sufficiently, the forces of attraction that exist between the molecules cause the gas to condense or solidify. <br> (c) Both NH\\(_3\\) and HCl diffuse along the tube. Where they meet, NH\\(_4\\)Cl(s) is formed. Since NH\\(_3\\) is a lighter molecule, it has a higher U\\(_{rms}\\), so it can travel further than HCl before they meet. <br> (d) Wind is air molecules going mostly in one direction. When the air molecules collide with the flag, the gas particles transfer some of their energy to the flag, causing it to flap."
